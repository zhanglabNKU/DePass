# DePass: A Dual-Enhanced Graph Learning Framework for Paired Data Integration in Single-Cell and Spatial Multi-Omics

DePass is a dual-enhanced graph learning framework for paired data integration in both single-cell and spatial multi-omics. It is capable of flexibly processing diverse modality combinations. Unlike existing methods, DePass uniquely incorporates data augmentation in model training. This data enhancement strategy leverages neighborhood information aggregation: each cell's expression value is refined using its spatial adjacent neighbors and feature-similar neighbors. Crucially, a feedback mechanism further refines neighbor selection by using integrated cross-modal representations to improve the accuracy of feature similarity estimation. This feedback-driven enhancement achieves iterative optimization of data refinement and integration during model training, gradually reducing noise while enhancing the quality of multi-omics integration. In addition, DePass incorporates a subgraph-based learning strategy to achieve scalability across large-scale datasets. The comprehensive benchmarking across six modality types, eight tissue types, and ten experimental platforms confirmed DePassâ€™s effectiveness. It consistently outperforms existing methods in clustering accuracy and biological spatial domain identification, highlighting its versatility and establishing it as a tool for robust multi-omics integration.

## Tutorials

For detailed tutorials, you can refer to the following resources:

- **GitHub Repository**: [DePass Tutorials on GitHub](https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/DePass/tree/main/Tutorials)  

- **Read the Docs**: [DePass Documentation](https://depass-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  



## DePass Installation

It is preferred to create a new environment for DePass.

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n DePass python==3.8.20
conda activate DePass
```

DePass is available on PyPI, and could be installed using:

```bash
pip install DePass
```

Installation via Github is also provided:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/DePass.git
cd DePass
pip install depass-0.0.16-py3-none-any.whl
```

Additionally, because DePass leverages mclust for clustering, installing R, the rpy2 Python interface, and the mclust R package is recommended.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-base rpy2 
conda install conda-forge::r-mclust
```

Install pytorch, pytorch geometric

```bash
pip install torch==2.4.1
pip install torch-geometric==2.3.1
pip install torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.4.0+cu121.html
```
